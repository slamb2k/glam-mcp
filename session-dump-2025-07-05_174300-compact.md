# Session Compact Memory - 2025-07-05_174300

## Executive Summary

This session focused on understanding and enhancing the slambed-mcp GitHub Flow automation tool. Major work included implementing stale branch detection, adding main branch update protection, refactoring configuration for clarity, and fixing linting errors that bypassed CI checks.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Stale Branch Detection**: Implemented comprehensive logic to detect and handle stale branches during auto-commit operations
2. **Main Branch Protection**: Added `ensureMainUpdated()` function to verify main branch is up-to-date before operations
3. **Configuration Refactoring**: Changed `requireUpdatedMain` to `allowOutdatedBase` with inverted logic for better clarity
4. **CI/CD Issues**: Identified and planned fixes for linting errors that made it through PR checks

## Important Findings

- âœ… Git conflicts can occur when local main branch diverges from origin
- âœ… Auto-commit continues even when linting fails (by design, but problematic)
- ðŸ“„ No branch protection rules on main branch allow failing PRs to merge
- ðŸ”§ Duplicate condition logic in if-else-if chains causing linting errors
- ðŸš€ Successfully merged PR #25 with configuration refactoring

## Key Decisions Made

- **Decision 1**: Always attempt to update main branch before operations, only continue if config explicitly allows
- **Decision 2**: Invert configuration logic to make safer behavior the default (fail on outdated base)
- **Decision 3**: Add CLI flags to override configuration on per-command basis
- **Decision 4**: Plan to add branch protection rules to prevent future CI bypass issues

## Code Changes Summary

- **Feature**: Added `ensureMainUpdated()` to git-helpers.js for main branch validation
- **Feature**: Added `allowOutdatedBase` configuration option with CLI flag support
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed stale branch handling in autoCommit with interactive prompts
- **Refactor**: Changed from `requireUpdatedMain` (true) to `allowOutdatedBase` (false)
- **Enhancement**: Added comprehensive error messages for various git scenarios

## Important Context for Future Sessions

- Project uses Node.js with Commander for CLI and MCP SDK for server
- Key files: src/tools/automation.js, src/tools/github-flow.js, src/utils/git-helpers.js
- Build command: `npm run build` (runs lint + test)
- Test command: `npm test`
- Linting: `npm run lint` (ESLint)
- Main branch needs protection rules to enforce CI checks
- Auto-commit intentionally continues on lint failures but this should be reconsidered
