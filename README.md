## Installation

```bash
npm install glam-mcp
```

## Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "glam": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/glam-mcp/src/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

For other MCP clients, refer to their specific configuration documentation.

## Usage

Once configured, glam-mcp tools are available to your AI assistant. The AI will intelligently orchestrate these tools based on your natural language requests.

### Example Workflows

**Starting a new feature:**
```
"I need to create a new feature for user authentication"
```
The AI assistant will use glam-mcp to:
- Check for existing related work
- Create an appropriate branch
- Set up the initial structure
- Suggest next steps

**Creating a pull request:**
```
"Let's create a PR for this feature"
```
Glam provides:
- Automatic commit grouping
- PR description generation
- Reviewer suggestions based on touched files
- Conflict warnings

## Response Structure

Every tool returns a rich response:

```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: { /* operation-specific data */ },
  context: {
    suggestions: ["next steps..."],
    risks: ["potential issues..."],
    relatedTools: ["tool_name"],
    teamActivity: { /* current team work */ },
    bestPractices: ["recommendations..."]
  },
  metadata: {
    operation: "tool_name",
    timestamp: "2024-01-09T10:00:00Z",
    affectedFiles: ["file1.js", "file2.js"],
    sessionContext: { /* session state */ }
  }
}
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Start in development mode
npm run dev
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline ensures code quality and stability through automated testing and checks.

### Pull Request Checks

Every pull request triggers the following checks:

- **Multiple Node.js Versions**: Tests run on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- **Test Suite**: Full test suite with coverage reporting
- **Code Linting**: ESLint checks for code quality
- **Format Checking**: Prettier validation for consistent formatting
- **Security Audit**: npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- **Build Verification**: Ensures the project builds successfully
- **Auto-labeling**: PRs are automatically labeled based on changed files

### Branch Protection

The `main` branch is protected with the following requirements:

- All CI checks must pass
- Branches must be up to date before merging
- Conversation resolution required before merging

### Running CI Locally

You can run the same checks locally before pushing:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Check linting
npm run lint

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Run security audit
npm audit
```

## Release Process

This project uses automated releases through GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

1. **Update Version**: Update the version in `package.json` according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
2. **Update Changelog**: Add your changes to `CHANGELOG.md` under the "Unreleased" section
3. **Commit Changes**: Commit with message like `chore: prepare release v1.2.3`
4. **Create Tag**: `git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3`

The automated workflow will:
- Validate the version format
- Run tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Generate release notes from commit history
- Publish to npm registry
- Create a GitHub release with artifacts
- Open a PR for the next version bump

### Manual Release

You can also trigger a release manually:
1. Go to Actions → Release → Run workflow
2. Enter the version number (e.g., `1.2.3`)
3. Check "pre-release" if applicable

### Pre-releases

For pre-releases, use version numbers like `1.2.3-beta.1` or `1.2.3-rc.1`. These will be published to npm with the `beta` tag.
