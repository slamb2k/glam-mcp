# Test Coverage Threshold Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased approach for gradually increasing test coverage thresholds from the current 70% to our target of 80% over the next 6 months.

## Current State (As of January 2025)

### Global Coverage Threshold: 70%
- Branches: 70%
- Functions: 70%
- Lines: 70%
- Statements: 70%

### Module-Specific Thresholds
- **Core modules** (`src/core/**/*`): 80%
- **Tools** (`src/tools/**/*`): 60%
- **Utilities** (`src/utils/**/*`): 70%
- **Services** (`src/services/**/*`): 50%
- **Clients** (`src/clients/**/*`): 50%

## Phased Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Current (January 2025)
- **Global threshold**: 70%
- **Focus**: Stabilize existing tests and fix failing tests
- **Key actions**:
  - Complete test failure analysis (Task 23) âœ“
  - Fix API contract mismatches (Task 24)
  - Update outdated test assertions (Task 25)
  - Remove obsolete tests (Task 26)

### Phase 2: March 2025
- **Global threshold**: 73%
- **Focus**: Improve coverage for critical paths
- **Key actions**:
  - Implement core enhanced response system tests (Task 29)
  - Add main server functionality tests (Task 30)
  - Increase tool coverage to 65%
  - Increase services coverage to 55%

### Phase 3: May 2025
- **Global threshold**: 76%
- **Focus**: Comprehensive tool testing
- **Key actions**:
  - Complete GitHub Flow tool tests (Task 31)
  - Complete automation tool tests (Task 32)
  - Implement remaining tool handler tests (Task 34)
  - Increase tool coverage to 70%
  - Increase utilities coverage to 75%

### Phase 4: July 2025
- **Global threshold**: 80%
- **Focus**: Polish and edge cases
- **Key actions**:
  - Add edge case tests for all modules
  - Achieve 85% coverage for core modules
  - Achieve 75% coverage for tools
  - Achieve 80% coverage for utilities
  - Achieve 60% coverage for services/clients

## Module-Specific Strategies

### Core Modules
- Priority: **High**
- Current target: 80%
- Strategy: Focus on unit tests for critical business logic, ensure all public APIs are tested

### Tools
- Priority: **Medium**
- Current target: 60%
- Strategy: Test primary functionality and error handling, mock external dependencies

### Utilities
- Priority: **Medium**
- Current target: 70%
- Strategy: Comprehensive unit tests for all utility functions

### Services/Clients
- Priority: **Low**
- Current target: 50%
- Strategy: Focus on integration tests and critical path testing

## Evaluation Criteria for Phase Transitions

Before moving to the next phase, ensure:
1. Current phase threshold is consistently met for 2 weeks
2. No regression in existing test coverage
3. All high-priority bugs from test failures are resolved
4. CI/CD pipeline is stable with the current thresholds

## Monitoring and Reporting

1. Weekly coverage reports generated and reviewed
2. Monthly progress review meetings
3. Quarterly stakeholder updates
4. Coverage trends tracked in CI/CD dashboards

## Risk Mitigation

- If a phase target cannot be met, extend the timeline rather than lowering quality
- Maintain a buffer of 2-3% above thresholds to prevent CI failures
- Regular code reviews to ensure new code includes tests
- Automated pre-commit hooks to check coverage locally

## Success Metrics

- Achieve 80% global coverage by July 2025
- Reduce test flakiness to <1%
- Maintain test execution time under 10 minutes
- Zero production bugs traced to untested code

## Resources Required

- Dedicated test improvement time: 20% of sprint capacity
- Test automation tools and infrastructure
- Team training on testing best practices
- Regular test review sessions
