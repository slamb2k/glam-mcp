# Slambed MCP Transformation - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Transform Slambed from a CLI-focused tool with 32 low-level commands into an MCP-first solution with semantic, intent-based tools that understand natural language and automate complex git workflows.

## Problem Statement
Current Slambed has:
- 31 tools across 3 CLI interfaces causing command overload
- Context switching between git, GitHub, npm operations
- Steep learning curve for new developers
- Repetitive manual tasks
- No intelligent automation or natural language understanding

## Solution Overview
Create an MCP-focused architecture with 5-7 high-level semantic tools that:
- Accept natural language commands ("implement user auth", "ship it")
- Understand context and predict developer intent
- Automate multi-step workflows
- Learn from user patterns
- Provide rich feedback for AI clients

## Core Requirements

### 1. MCP Semantic Tools
- Universal 'slam' tool for natural language commands
- 'slam_develop' for feature development workflows
- 'slam_ship' for deployment pipelines
- 'slam_collaborate' for team synchronization
- 'slam_context' for rich context provision
- 'slam_recover' for undo/recovery operations
- 'slam_learn' for personalization

### 2. Context Engine
- Track git state, branches, commits, conflicts
- Monitor project structure and dependencies
- Maintain team activity awareness
- Analyze user patterns and preferences
- Provide temporal context (deadlines, schedules)

### 3. Intent Resolution Layer
- Parse natural language into structured intents
- Map user requests to appropriate tool invocations
- Handle ambiguous commands intelligently
- Suggest clarifications when needed

### 4. Workflow Orchestrator
- Execute complex multi-step operations
- Support parallel execution where possible
- Handle rollbacks on failure
- Track progress for long-running operations
- Support declarative workflow definitions

### 5. AI Integration
- Local models for fast predictions
- Cloud models for complex analysis
- Generate commit messages and PR descriptions
- Provide code review suggestions
- Learn from codebase patterns

### 6. State Management
- SQLite database for persistent context
- Session tracking across MCP invocations
- Audit trail for all operations
- State recovery mechanisms

### 7. Backward Compatibility
- Keep existing tools as internal utilities
- Expose new semantic layer via MCP
- Maintain CLI interface for direct access
- Support gradual migration

### Tool Response Format
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "workflow": "feature-development",
  "steps_completed": ["branch", "commit", "test"],
  "current_state": { /* rich context */ },
  "suggestions": [
    "Ready to create PR? Say 'slam share with team'",
    "3 failing tests need attention"
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Create MCP directory structure
- Implement Context Engine foundation
- Build Intent Resolution Layer
- Create basic 'slam' natural language tool
- Set up state management with SQLite

### Phase 2: Core Tools (Weeks 5-8)
- Implement 'slam_develop' workflow tool
- Create 'slam_ship' deployment tool
- Build Workflow Orchestrator
- Integrate with existing git-helpers

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Weeks 9-12)
- Add AI-powered commit messages
- Implement predictive suggestions
- Create 'slam_context' rich context tool
- Build learning system foundation

### Phase 4: Collaboration (Weeks 13-16)
- Implement 'slam_collaborate' team features
- Add real-time sync capabilities
- Build conflict prevention system
- Create team awareness features

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 17-20)
- Implement 'slam_recover' time machine
- Add 'slam_learn' personalization
- Create visual interfaces (TUI/Web)
- Build IDE integrations

## Success Metrics
- Reduce command memorization from 32 to 1
- 80% of workflows completable via natural language
- 10x reduction in git-related errors
- 90% of routine operations automated
- 50% reduction in merge conflicts
- Zero-touch deployments for simple changes

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each MCP component
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end tests for natural language processing
- Performance tests for context engine
- User acceptance testing with real workflows

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of context data
- API key management for AI services
- Audit logging for all operations
- Permission checks for destructive operations
- Encrypted communication for team features

## Migration Plan
- Phase 1: Deploy alongside existing tools
- Phase 2: Beta test with volunteer users
- Phase 3: Gradual rollout with documentation
- Phase 4: Deprecate old tools after adoption
- Phase 5: Full migration complete

## Dependencies
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for MCP server
- SQLite for state persistence
- AI model APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Existing git-helpers utilities
- Node.js 18+ runtime

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: AI model costs - Mitigation: Use local models where possible
- Risk: Breaking changes - Mitigation: Maintain backward compatibility
- Risk: Performance issues - Mitigation: Implement caching and optimization
- Risk: User adoption - Mitigation: Gradual rollout with training

## Future Enhancements
- Voice control integration
- Mobile app support
- Autonomous agent mode
- Multi-repo management
- Advanced analytics dashboard
