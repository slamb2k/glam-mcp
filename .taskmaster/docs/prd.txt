# Product Requirements Document: MCP-Centric Slambed Architecture

## Project Overview
Transform Slambed from a hybrid CLI/MCP tool into a pure MCP server that provides rich, contextual responses for AI assistants. This shift embraces the MCP paradigm where AI assistants handle user interaction while Slambed provides intelligent development experiences.

## Key Objectives
- Remove all CLI interfaces and dependencies to create a pure MCP server
- Enhance tool responses with rich contextual information and metadata
- Implement session state tracking and team awareness features
- Leverage AI assistant capabilities for natural language understanding and workflow orchestration
- Create a development experience like "pair programming with a senior developer"

## Core Features

### 1. Pure MCP Server Architecture
Remove all CLI components including the bin/ directory and CLI dependencies (commander, inquirer). Focus entirely on providing MCP tools with rich, contextual responses that AI assistants can use to deliver intelligent development experiences.

### 2. Enhanced Response System
Implement a new response structure that includes:
- Core operation results (success/failure, data)
- Context object with suggestions, risks, related tools, team activity, and best practices
- Metadata including operation type, timestamp, affected files, and session context
All responses should provide enough information for AI assistants to guide users effectively.

### 3. Session Context Management
Build stateful context tracking that maintains:
- Current branch and repository state
- Recently modified files and uncommitted changes
- Operation history within the current session
- User preferences (in-memory storage)
This allows for more intelligent, context-aware tool suggestions and warnings.

### 4. Team Awareness Features
Implement tools and response enrichment to:
- Detect when other team members are working on related code
- Suggest appropriate reviewers based on file ownership
- Warn about potential conflicts before they occur
- Track recent team activity on branches and files

### 5. New Tool Categories
Add three new categories of tools:
- Context Tools: get_session_context, set_user_preference, get_recent_operations
- Team Tools: check_team_activity, find_related_work, suggest_reviewers
- Safety Tools: analyze_operation_risk, check_for_conflicts, validate_preconditions

### 6. Tool Enhancement
Enhance all existing tools with:
- Semantic descriptions explaining "when to use" and "what it solves"
- Usage examples in tool descriptions
- Risk assessment metadata
- Contextual suggestions for next steps
- Related tool recommendations

## Technical Requirements

### Response Enrichment Layer
Create enhancers for:
- Metadata generation (operation details, timestamps, affected files)
- Suggestion generation (next steps based on current state)
- Risk analysis (potential issues, conflicts, safety concerns)
- Team activity detection (who's working on what)

### Directory Structure
Reorganize to support pure MCP architecture:
- src/index.js - Pure MCP server entry point
- src/tools/ - Enhanced tool implementations (github-flow, automation, utilities, context, team)
- src/enhancers/ - Response enrichment modules
- src/context/ - Session and preference management
- src/utils/ - Existing utilities (git-helpers, responses)

### Integration Points
Maintain capability to integrate with:
- Git for version control operations
- GitHub CLI for PR and issue management
- Team collaboration tools (future: Jira, Slack)
- CI/CD systems for workflow automation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Simplify to Pure MCP
Remove CLI components and update package.json to focus on MCP server functionality. This includes deleting the bin/ directory, removing CLI dependencies, and simplifying the entry point.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Response System
Implement the new response structure with context and metadata. Start with high-value tools like github_flow_start and auto_commit.

### Phase 3: Session Context Management
Build the stateful context tracking system including current branch tracking, file modification history, and operation history.

### Phase 4: Tool Enhancement
Add semantic descriptions, usage examples, and risk metadata to all tools. Include "when to use" guidance and related tool suggestions.

### Phase 5: New Tool Categories
Implement context tools, team tools, and safety tools to provide richer development experiences.

## Success Criteria
- All CLI components successfully removed
- Every tool returns rich contextual responses
- Session state properly tracked across operations
- Team awareness features prevent conflicts
- AI assistants can orchestrate complex workflows using tool responses
- Development experience feels like intelligent pair programming

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP tool interfaces
- Ensure response times remain under 500ms for most operations
- Keep memory footprint reasonable for session tracking
- Provide clear error messages with recovery suggestions
- Support concurrent operations where safe

## Future Considerations
- Plugin system for custom tool additions
- Persistent preference storage
- Advanced team collaboration features
- Integration with more external services
- Machine learning for pattern detection
