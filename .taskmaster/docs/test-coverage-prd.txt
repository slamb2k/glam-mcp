# Test Coverage Improvement Plan for glam-mcp

## Overview
The glam-mcp project currently has ~21% test coverage with a configured threshold of 90%. This plan outlines a pragmatic approach to improve test coverage while balancing effort versus benefit.

## Current State Analysis
- Current coverage: 21.18% (statements), 18.48% (branches), 27.8% (functions), 21.47% (lines)
- Target threshold: 90% across all metrics
- Total failing tests: 229 out of 515
- Major gaps: Tool handlers, services, clients, enhanced-server

## Objectives
1. Achieve a realistic and maintainable test coverage target
2. Fix failing tests to ensure CI/CD pipeline stability
3. Focus testing efforts on critical paths and high-risk areas
4. Establish sustainable testing practices

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Priority: Critical)
- Fix all failing tests by aligning with actual API implementations
- Update test assertions to match current codebase behavior
- Remove or update obsolete tests

### Phase 2: Realistic Target Setting (Priority: High)
- Lower coverage threshold from 90% to 70% for initial milestone
- Set long-term goal of 80% coverage
- Configure different thresholds for different parts of codebase:
  - Core modules: 80%
  - Tools: 60%
  - Utilities: 70%
  - Clients/Services: 50%

### Phase 3: Strategic Test Implementation (Priority: High)
- Focus on testing critical paths first:
  - Core enhanced response system
  - Main server functionality
  - Most-used tools (github-flow, automation)
- Use integration tests over unit tests for tools
- Mock external dependencies consistently

### Phase 4: Tool Handler Testing (Priority: Medium)
- Create test helpers for tool testing
- Test happy paths for each tool
- Add tests for common error scenarios
- Skip edge cases unless they represent real risks

### Phase 5: Documentation and Maintenance (Priority: Medium)
- Document testing approach and patterns
- Create test templates for new tools
- Set up coverage reporting in CI
- Establish code review guidelines for test coverage

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing (0 failing tests)
- 70% overall test coverage achieved
- Critical paths have 80%+ coverage
- New code requires tests in PR reviews
- Coverage trends upward over time

## Technical Approach
- Use Jest with proper ESM support
- Create shared test utilities for mocking
- Focus on behavior testing over implementation
- Prioritize integration tests for tools
- Use snapshot testing where appropriate

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk: Time investment too high
  - Mitigation: Focus on high-value tests only
- Risk: Tests become brittle
  - Mitigation: Test behavior, not implementation
- Risk: Mock complexity
  - Mitigation: Create reusable mock utilities

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 0.5 days
- Phase 3: 3-4 days
- Phase 4: 2-3 days
- Phase 5: 1-2 days
Total: 7.5-11.5 days of effort
