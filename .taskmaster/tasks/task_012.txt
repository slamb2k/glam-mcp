# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Tests for Remaining Tool Handlers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create tests for the remaining tool handlers, focusing on happy paths and common error scenarios.
# Details:
For each remaining tool handler:
1. Identify the core functionality and expected outputs
2. Create tests for the happy path (successful execution)
3. Add tests for common error scenarios
4. Skip edge cases unless they represent significant risks

Use the test helpers created earlier to maintain consistency across tool tests.

# Test Strategy:
Use integration tests to verify tool behavior. Focus on testing from the perspective of the tool's consumers rather than implementation details.
