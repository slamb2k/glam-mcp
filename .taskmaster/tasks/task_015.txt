# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Create guidelines for reviewing test coverage in pull requests.

Develop code review guidelines that include:
1. Expectations for test coverage of new code
2. Checklist for reviewing test quality
3. Process for handling exceptions to coverage requirements
4. Templates for test-related feedback

Example guideline items:
- New features should have at least 70% test coverage

Integrate these guidelines into the PR template and code review process.

# Test Strategy:
Pilot the guidelines on several PRs and gather feedback. Refine based on practical application and team input.
