# Task ID: 3
# Title: Update Outdated Test Assertions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Revise test assertions that no longer match the expected behavior of the current codebase.
# Details:
For tests with outdated assertions:
1. Review the current implementation to understand the correct behavior
2. Update assertions to match the current expected outputs
3. Add comments explaining the behavioral changes where significant

Prioritize tests in core modules and critical paths.

# Test Strategy:
Run updated tests to verify they pass. For significant behavior changes, add additional test cases to verify the new behavior is fully covered.
