# Task ID: 5
# Title: Configure Adjusted Coverage Thresholds
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Update Jest configuration to set realistic coverage thresholds based on the proposed solution.
# Details:
Modify the Jest configuration file (jest.config.js) to:
1. Lower overall coverage threshold from 90% to 70% initially, with plans to gradually increase to 80% as test coverage improves
2. Set up different thresholds for different parts of the codebase:
   - Core modules: 80%
   - Tools: 60%
   - Utilities: 70%
   - Clients/Services: 50%
3. Configure Jest to generate detailed coverage reports

Example implementation in jest.config.js:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Other Jest configuration options...
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageReporters: ['json', 'lcov', 'text', 'clover', 'html'],
  coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      statements: 70, // Initially set to 70%, plan to increase to 80%
      branches: 70,
      functions: 70,
      lines: 70
    },
    './src/core/': {
      statements: 80,
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80
    },
    './src/tools/': {
      statements: 60,
      branches: 60,
      functions: 60,
      lines: 60
    },
    './src/utils/': {
      statements: 70,
      branches: 70,
      functions: 70,
      lines: 70
    },
    './src/clients/': {
      statements: 50,
      branches: 50,
      functions: 50,
      lines: 50
    },
    './src/services/': {
      statements: 50,
      branches: 50,
      functions: 50,
      lines: 50
    }
  }
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the test suite with the new configuration to verify thresholds are applied correctly
2. Check that coverage reports are generated with the expected granularity
3. Verify that the module-specific thresholds are correctly applied to their respective directories
4. Document the current coverage levels and the plan to gradually increase the global threshold to 80%
