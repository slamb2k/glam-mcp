# Task ID: 2
# Title: Fix API Contract Mismatch Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Update tests with incorrect API expectations to align with the current implementation.
# Details:
For each test identified with API contract mismatches:
1. Compare test expectations with actual API implementation
2. Update test mocks and assertions to match current API contracts
3. Document any API changes that weren't properly communicated

Focus on high-impact areas first, particularly in core modules and frequently used tools.

# Test Strategy:
Run fixed tests to verify they pass. Create a regression test suite to ensure these tests remain aligned with API contracts in the future.
