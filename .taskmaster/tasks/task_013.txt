# Task ID: 13
# Title: Set Up Coverage Reporting in CI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure CI pipeline to generate and display test coverage reports.
# Details:
Update CI configuration to:
1. Run tests with coverage enabled
2. Generate coverage reports in a standard format
3. Display coverage metrics in the CI interface
4. Optionally, integrate with a coverage tracking service

Example CI configuration (for GitHub Actions):
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: npm run test:coverage
      - name: Upload coverage reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: coverage-report
          path: coverage/
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify that coverage reports are generated correctly in the CI environment. Check that the reports include all the expected metrics and file details.
