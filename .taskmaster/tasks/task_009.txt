# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Tests for GitHub Flow Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create tests for the GitHub Flow tool, focusing on integration testing of key functionality.
# Details:
Develop tests covering:
1. Repository interaction (clone, commit, push)
2. Branch management
3. Pull request creation and management
4. Error handling for common GitHub API failures

Mock the GitHub API responses using the test utilities. Focus on testing the tool's behavior rather than implementation details.

# Test Strategy:
Use integration tests to verify the tool's interaction with the GitHub API. Create mock responses for different API scenarios. Test both successful operations and error handling.
