# Task ID: 4
# Title: Remove or Refactor Obsolete Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify and handle tests for deprecated or removed functionality.
# Details:
For obsolete tests:
1. Confirm if the functionality being tested still exists
2. If functionality was removed, remove the test with appropriate documentation
3. If functionality was replaced, refactor test to target new implementation
4. If functionality was moved, relocate test to appropriate location

Maintain a log of removed tests with justification for audit purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that removing or refactoring these tests doesn't decrease coverage of existing functionality. Run the test suite to ensure no regressions are introduced.
