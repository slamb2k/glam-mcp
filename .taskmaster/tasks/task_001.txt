# Task ID: 1
# Title: Analyze Failing Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the 229 failing tests to identify patterns and root causes of failures.
# Details:
Create a script to categorize failing tests by module and error type. Group failures into categories such as:
- API contract mismatches
- Outdated assertions
- Environment setup issues
- Timing/async issues
- Obsolete tests

Generate a report with statistics on failure types and recommendations for fixes. This will serve as the foundation for the stabilization phase.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the analysis script by manually verifying a sample of categorized tests to ensure accuracy of the categorization logic.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Script to Extract and Parse Test Failure Data [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a script that can extract data from failing test logs and parse it into a structured format for analysis.
### Details:
The script should: 1) Connect to the test results database or log files, 2) Extract relevant information such as test name, error message, stack trace, and execution environment, 3) Parse the data into a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV), 4) Handle different log formats and error patterns, 5) Include error handling for missing or corrupted data.

## 2. Implement Categorization Logic for Different Failure Types [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create logic to categorize test failures into meaningful groups based on error patterns, messages, and other attributes.
### Details:
This subtask involves: 1) Defining failure categories (e.g., network issues, timeout errors, assertion failures, etc.), 2) Implementing pattern matching algorithms to identify error types, 3) Creating rules for categorization based on keywords, stack traces, and error codes, 4) Building a classification system that can be extended for new failure types, 5) Documenting the categorization logic for future reference.

## 3. Generate Statistical Analysis of Failure Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Develop analytics to identify trends, frequencies, and correlations in test failures across different dimensions.
### Details:
The analysis should: 1) Calculate failure frequencies by category, test module, and time period, 2) Identify tests with the highest failure rates, 3) Detect correlations between failure types and test environments, 4) Track failure trends over time, 5) Apply statistical methods to highlight significant patterns, 6) Generate visualizations (charts, graphs) to represent the data.

## 4. Develop Reporting Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create a reporting system that presents the analysis results in a clear, actionable format for stakeholders.
### Details:
The reporting mechanism should: 1) Generate comprehensive reports with summary statistics and detailed breakdowns, 2) Support multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, email), 3) Include visualizations of key metrics and trends, 4) Provide filtering and sorting capabilities for different views of the data, 5) Implement scheduling for regular report generation, 6) Include recommendations or highlights of critical issues.

## 5. Validate Analysis with Sample Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the analysis system using known test failure samples.
### Details:
Validation should include: 1) Selecting a representative sample of test failures with known root causes, 2) Running the complete analysis pipeline on the sample data, 3) Comparing the automated categorization with manual classification, 4) Measuring accuracy metrics (precision, recall), 5) Refining the categorization logic based on validation results, 6) Documenting validation findings and system limitations.
