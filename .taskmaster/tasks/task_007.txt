# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Core Enhanced Response System Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive tests for the core enhanced response system, focusing on critical functionality.
# Details:
Develop tests covering:
1. Response generation and formatting
2. Error handling and recovery
3. Integration with different tools
4. Performance under various loads

Use a combination of unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the system as a whole. Mock external dependencies using the test utilities created earlier.

# Test Strategy:
Verify core functionality through both unit and integration tests. Use snapshot testing for response formats. Test error handling by simulating various failure scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Unit Tests for Response Generation and Formatting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive unit tests to verify the response generation logic and output formatting functionality of the enhanced response system.
### Details:
Implement test cases that validate: correct content generation based on different inputs, proper formatting of responses according to defined templates, handling of different response types (text, structured data, media), validation of response metadata, and boundary testing for response size limits. Use mocking to isolate the response generation components from external dependencies.

## 2. Implement Tests for Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Design and execute tests that specifically target the error handling capabilities and recovery processes of the response system.
### Details:
Create test scenarios for: invalid input handling, timeout management, service unavailability recovery, malformed data processing, security exception handling, and graceful degradation under partial system failure. Include both expected and unexpected error conditions, and verify that appropriate error messages are generated and that the system can recover to a stable state.

## 3. Develop Integration Tests with Different Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create integration test suites that verify the response system's compatibility and correct functioning with various external tools and services.
### Details:
Implement tests for integration with: data sources and APIs, authentication services, content delivery networks, analytics platforms, and any other third-party tools. Verify correct data flow between systems, proper handling of API contracts, authentication and authorization processes, and end-to-end functionality across the integrated ecosystem.

## 4. Design and Execute Performance and Load Testing Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive performance testing plan to evaluate the response system's behavior under various load conditions and identify performance bottlenecks.
### Details:
Implement tests for: response time measurement under different loads, throughput capacity assessment, concurrent request handling, resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, network), scalability verification, and long-running stability tests. Use appropriate performance testing tools to simulate realistic user loads and traffic patterns, and establish performance baselines and acceptable thresholds.
