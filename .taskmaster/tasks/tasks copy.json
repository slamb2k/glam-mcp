It enables intelligent development experiences by providing tools for GitHub workflow, automation, team collaboration, and more.\n\n## Installation\n```bash\nnpm install glam-mcp\n```\n\n## Usage\n```javascript\nconst glamMcp = require('glam-mcp');\n\n// Initialize the MCP server\nconst server = glamMcp();\n\n// Get all available tools\nconst tools = server.getTools();\n\n// Use a specific tool\nconst result = await tools.github_flow_start({ name: 'feature-branch' });\nconsole.log(result);\n```\n\n## Response Structure\nAll tools return enhanced responses with the following structure:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  result: {\n    success: boolean,\n    data: any,\n    message: string\n  },\n  context: {\n    suggestions: string[],\n    risks: string[],\n    relatedTools: string[],\n    teamActivity: any[],\n    bestPractices: string[]\n  },\n  metadata: {\n    operationType: string,\n    timestamp: string,\n    affectedFiles: string[],\n    sessionContext: object\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Available Tools\n\n### GitHub Flow Tools\n- `github_flow_start`: Start a new feature branch following GitHub Flow\n- `auto_commit`: Automatically commit changes with a descriptive message\n\n### Automation Tools\n- `run_tests`: Run test suite or specific tests\n- `analyze_code`: Analyze code for quality issues\n\n### Utility Tools\n- `get_status`: Get the status of the current repository\n- `get_repo_info`: Get information about the current repository\n\n### Context Tools\n- `get_session_context`: Get the current session context\n- `set_user_preference`: Set a user preference\n- `get_recent_operations`: Get recent operations history\n\n### Team Tools\n- `check_team_activity`: Check for team activity on related files\n- `find_related_work`: Find related work (branches, PRs)\n- `suggest_reviewers`: Suggest reviewers based on file ownership\n\n### Safety Tools\n- `analyze_operation_risk`: Analyze the risk of a proposed operation\n- `check_for_conflicts`: Check for potential conflicts\n- `validate_preconditions`: Validate preconditions for an operation\n\n## Integration with AI Assistants\n\nglam-mcp is designed to be used by AI assistants to provide intelligent development experiences. Here's an example of how an AI assistant might use glam-mcp:\n\n```javascript\n// AI assistant code\nconst glamMcp = require('glam-mcp');\nconst server = glamMcp();\n\nasync function handleUserRequest(request) {\n  if (request.includes('start a new feature')) {\n    // Extract feature name from request\n    const featureName = extractFeatureName(request);\n    \n    // Use glam-mcp to start a new feature branch\n    const result = await server.getTool('github_flow_start')({ name: featureName });\n    \n    // Use the rich response to guide the user\n    if (result.success) {\n      return {\n        message: `I've created a new branch '${featureName}' for you.`,\n        suggestions: result.context.suggestions,\n        nextSteps: result.context.relatedTools.map(tool => `Would you like to ${toolToAction(tool)}?`)\n      };\n    } else {\n      return {\n        message: `I couldn't create the branch: ${result.message}`,\n        suggestions: result.context.suggestions\n      };\n    }\n  }\n  \n  // Handle other requests...\n}\n```\n\n## Session Context\n\nglam-mcp maintains session context across operations, including:\n\n- Current branch and repository state\n- Recently modified files\n- Operation history\n- User preferences\n\nThis context is used to provide more intelligent and contextual responses.\n\n## Team Awareness\n\nglam-mcp includes features for team awareness, such as:\n\n- Detecting when other team members are working on related code\n- Suggesting appropriate reviewers\n- Warning about potential conflicts\n\n## Developer Workflow Optimization\n\nglam-mcp enhances developer productivity through:\n\n- Automated routine tasks\n- Contextual suggestions based on current work\n- Intelligent code analysis and recommendations\n- Streamlined collaboration with team members\n- AI-assisted development workflows\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe MCP-centric architecture consists of:\n\n- Core MCP server with tool registry\n- Context management system\n- Integration adapters for various development environments\n- Event system for real-time updates\n- Persistence layer for session and preference storage\n\n## Project Initialization\n\nTo initialize a new project with glam-mcp:\n\n```javascript\nconst glamMcp = require('glam-mcp');\n\n// Create a new project configuration\nconst config = glamMcp.createProjectConfig({\n  name: 'my-project',\n  repository: 'https://github.com/username/repo',\n  preferences: {\n    defaultBranch: 'main',\n    commitMessageTemplate: 'feat: {{message}}'\n  }\n});\n\n// Initialize the project\nconst project = await glamMcp.initializeProject(config);\n```\n\n## Test-Driven Development with Jest\n\nglam-mcp follows a strict TDD approach using the Jest framework. All features must be developed using test-first methodology.\n\n### Test Coverage Requirements\n\nThe project maintains a minimum of 90% test coverage for all code. Coverage reports are generated as part of the CI/CD pipeline.\n\n```javascript\n// Example Jest configuration with coverage settings\nmodule.exports = {\n  preset: 'ts-jest',\n  testEnvironment: 'node',\n  collectCoverage: true,\n  coverageThreshold: {\n    global: {\n      branches: 90,\n      functions: 90,\n      lines: 90,\n      statements: 90\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Test-First Development Example\n\n```javascript\n// 1. First, write the test for a new feature\n// file: src/tools/github-flow.test.js\ndescribe('github_flow_start', () => {\n  it('should create a new feature branch with the given name', async () => {\n    // Arrange\n    const tool = require('../tools/github-flow').github_flow_start;\n    const mockRepo = { createBranch: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(true) };\n    const context = { repository: mockRepo };\n    \n    // Act\n    const result = await tool({ name: 'feature-branch' }, context);\n    \n    // Assert\n    expect(mockRepo.createBranch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('feature-branch');\n    expect(result.success).toBe(true);\n    expect(result.data).toHaveProperty('branchName', 'feature-branch');\n  });\n});\n\n// 2. Then, implement the feature to make the test pass\n// file: src/tools/github-flow.js\nexports.github_flow_start = async (params, context) => {\n  const { name } = params;\n  const { repository } = context;\n  \n  try {\n    await repository.createBranch(name);\n    return {\n      success: true,\n      data: { branchName: name },\n      message: `Successfully created branch '${name}'`\n    };\n  } catch (error) {\n    return {\n      success: false,\n      message: `Failed to create branch: ${error.message}`\n    };\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## CI/CD Integration\n\nglam-mcp integrates with CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and test coverage:\n\n```yaml\n# Example GitHub Actions workflow\nname: glam-mcp CI/CD\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main, develop ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main, develop ]\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Use Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n        with:\n          node-version: '16'\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npm test\n      - name: Check test coverage\n        run: npx jest --coverage\n      - name: Upload coverage reports\n        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2\n\n  deploy:\n    needs: test\n    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Use Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n        with:\n          node-version: '16'\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npm run build\n      - name: Publish to NPM\n        run: npm publish\n        env:\n          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}\n```\n\n## License\nMIT\n```",
