# MCP-Centric Glam Architecture & Implementation Plan

## Core Architecture

### 1. Pure MCP Server Design
- Remove all CLI interfaces (`bin/` directory and CLI dependencies)
- Focus on providing rich, contextual MCP tool responses
- Let AI assistants handle all user interaction and intelligence

### 2. Enhanced Tool Response Structure
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: { /* core operation result */ },
  context: {
    suggestions: ["Next steps..."],
    risks: ["Potential issues..."],
    relatedTools: ["tool1", "tool2"],
    teamActivity: ["Recent related work..."],
    bestPractices: "Recommendations..."
  },
  metadata: {
    operation: "operation_name",
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    affectedFiles: [],
    sessionContext: { /* state tracking */ }
  }
}
```

## Features Leveraging AI Assistant Capabilities

### AI Handles These (No Glam LLM Needed):
1. **Natural Language Understanding** - AI interprets user intent
2. **Workflow Orchestration** - AI chains tool calls intelligently
3. **Conversational Context** - AI maintains conversation state
4. **Risk Reasoning** - AI evaluates safety before operations
5. **Pattern Learning** - AI adapts to user preferences over time
6. **Teaching Mode** - AI explains while executing

### Glam Provides These:
1. **Rich Tool Metadata** - Detailed context in every response
2. **Session State Tracking** - Current branch, uncommitted files, recent ops
3. **Team Awareness** - Detect conflicts, suggest reviewers
4. **Safety Information** - Risk analysis data (AI interprets)
5. **Integration Hooks** - Connect with Jira, Slack, etc.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Simplify to Pure MCP
- Remove `bin/` directory and CLI tools
- Remove CLI dependencies (commander, inquirer)
- Update package.json to focus on MCP server
- Simplify entry point to MCP-only

### Phase 2: Enhanced Response System
- Create response enrichment layer
- Add context object to all tool responses
- Include suggestions, risks, and next steps
- Implement team activity detection

### Phase 3: Session Context Management
- Build stateful context tracking
- Track current branch, files, operations
- Maintain recent operation history
- Enable preference storage (in-memory)

### Phase 4: Tool Enhancement
- Add semantic descriptions to all tools
- Include "when to use" and "what it solves"
- Provide usage examples
- Add risk assessment metadata

### Phase 5: New Tool Categories
```javascript
// Context Tools
- get_session_context
- set_user_preference
- get_recent_operations

// Team Tools  
- check_team_activity
- find_related_work
- suggest_reviewers

// Safety Tools
- analyze_operation_risk
- check_for_conflicts
- validate_preconditions
```

## Directory Structure
```
src/
  index.js          // Pure MCP server
  tools/            // Enhanced tool implementations
    github-flow.js
    automation.js
    utilities.js
    context.js      // New context tools
    team.js         // New team tools

    session.js
    preferences.js
  utils/           // Existing utilities
    git-helpers.js
    responses.js
```

## Key Benefits
1. **No backward compatibility concerns** - Fresh start as MCP-only
2. **Leverages AI intelligence** - No need to build our own NLP/ML
3. **Rich contextual responses** - AI has all info needed to be helpful
4. **Team-aware operations** - Prevents conflicts proactively
5. **Educational by design** - Every response can teach

## Example Enhanced Tool Implementation

```javascript
// Before: Simple tool response
export async function github_flow_start({ name, type }) {
  const result = await startBranch(name, type);
  return createSuccessResponse(`Created ${type}/${name}`, result);
}

// After: Rich contextual response
export async function github_flow_start({ name, type }) {
  const result = await startBranch(name, type);
  
  // Analyze current state for context
  const mainBranch = await getMainBranch();
  const behindCount = await getBehindCount(mainBranch);
  const teamActivity = await checkTeamActivity(type, name);
  
  return {
    ...createSuccessResponse(`Created ${type}/${name}`, result),
    context: {
      suggestions: [
        "Next: Make your changes and commit them",
        behindCount > 0 ? `Consider syncing with ${mainBranch} (${behindCount} commits behind)` : null,
        "Run tests before committing"
      ].filter(Boolean),
      risks: [
        behindCount > 10 ? `Branch is significantly behind ${mainBranch}` : null,
        teamActivity.length > 0 ? "Other team members working on related code" : null
      ].filter(Boolean),
      relatedTools: ["analyze_changes", "auto_commit", "github_flow_sync"],
      teamActivity: teamActivity,
      bestPractices: "Keep feature branches short-lived to avoid conflicts"
    },
    metadata: {
      operation: "branch_create",
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      affectedFiles: [],
      branchInfo: {
        name: `${type}/${name}`,
        baseBranch: mainBranch,
        behindCount: behindCount
      }
    }
  };
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Fork or Branch
Create a new branch `mcp-centric` to preserve the current hybrid approach

### Step 2: Remove CLI Components
- Delete `bin/` directory
- Remove CLI-specific dependencies
- Update package.json scripts

### Step 3: Enhance Core Tools
Start with high-value tools like `github_flow_start` and `auto_commit`

### Step 4: Add Context System
Implement session tracking and preference management

### Step 5: Gradual Enhancement
Progressively enhance all tools with rich responses

### Step 6: Documentation
Update README and create comprehensive MCP tool documentation

## Vision Alignment

This approach fully embraces the MCP paradigm from the vision document where:
- "MCP transforms Glam from a tool into a development partner"
- "The AI assistant becomes the intelligent interface"
- "The command line is dead. Long live the conversation"

By making Glam a pure MCP server that provides intelligent development experiences through AI assistants, we achieve the goal of creating a development experience that "feels like pair programming with a senior developer who never forgets, never gets tired, and is always learning."
