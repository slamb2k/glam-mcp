# Issue Command Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a new `slambed issue` command that integrates GitHub issues with the branch workflow, allowing developers to:
1. List and search GitHub issues
2. Create branches automatically from issues
3. Link commits and PRs to issues

## Key Features

### 1. Issue Listing and Filtering
- `slambed issue` - Lists all open issues
- `slambed issue -c` - Includes closed issues
- `slambed issue -a <username>` - Filter by assignee
- `slambed issue -L <label>` - Filter by label
- `slambed issue -m <milestone>` - Filter by milestone

### 2. Issue Selection and Branch Creation
- `slambed issue <id>` - Creates branch from specific issue ID
- `slambed issue <search_term>` - Searches issues by title/body
- Interactive selection menu when multiple matches found
- Automatic branch naming: `issue/123-fix-login-bug`

### 3. Issue Metadata Storage
The command stores issue information in git config for the branch:
- `branch.<name>.issue-number` - Issue number
- `branch.<name>.issue-title` - Issue title
- `branch.<name>.issue-url` - Issue URL

### 4. Automatic Issue Linking
- **Commits**: Issue references are automatically added to commit messages (e.g., "Fix login bug (#123)")
- **Pull Requests**: PRs automatically include "Fixes #123" in the description
- **PR Titles**: Use the issue title when creating PRs

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`/bin/slambed.js`**
   - Added new `issue` command with full option parsing
   - Integrated with interactive mode
   - Handles GitHub CLI authentication checks
   - Implements issue search, filtering, and branch creation logic

2. **`/src/tools/github-flow.js`**
   - Enhanced `finishBranch()` to check for issue metadata
   - Automatically includes issue references in PR titles and descriptions
   - Maintains backward compatibility with non-issue branches

3. **`/src/tools/automation.js`**
   - Updated `autoCommit()` to check for issue metadata
   - Automatically appends issue references to commit messages

4. **`/README.md`**
   - Added documentation for the new issue command
   - Added examples of issue-based development workflow

## Usage Examples

```bash
# List all open issues
slambed issue

# Create branch from issue #123
slambed issue 123

# Search for issues containing "login"
slambed issue login

# Filter issues by assignee
slambed issue -a johndoe

# Include closed issues in search
slambed issue -c login
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No GitHub CLI**: Shows error with installation instructions
2. **No issues found**: Displays appropriate message
3. **Closed issues**: Prompts for confirmation before creating branch
4. **Existing branch**: Offers to switch to existing branch
5. **No matches**: Shows helpful message about no matches

## Integration with Existing Workflow

The issue command seamlessly integrates with the existing Slambed workflow:

1. Create branch from issue: `slambed issue 123`
2. Make changes to code
3. Commit with auto-reference: `slambed auto commit -m "Fix the bug"`
4. Create PR with auto-link: `slambed flow finish`

The PR will automatically:
- Use the issue title as PR title
- Include "Fixes #123" in the description
- Link to the original issue

## Benefits

1. **Traceability**: Every branch, commit, and PR is linked to an issue
2. **Automation**: No manual copying of issue numbers or titles
3. **Consistency**: Standardized branch naming and PR formatting
4. **Efficiency**: Fewer context switches between GitHub and terminal
5. **Discovery**: Easy issue search and filtering from CLI

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Support for creating new issues from CLI
2. Ability to update issue status/labels
3. Integration with project boards
4. Bulk operations on multiple issues
5. Issue comment integration
